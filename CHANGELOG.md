# Changelog

## [0.0.2] - 2026-08-30

- Made an unexpected non-text controller state fail safe as `OFFLINE` instead
  of raising while evaluating the CNC cell boundary.
- Synchronized the English README and all six translated README files with
  the current version.
- Successful incremental build: synchronized package metadata and
  `hydra-umc.project.json`.

## [0.0.1]

- Added fail-safe CNC cell snapshot and SDK safety-gate tests.
- Added non-mutating build-test scripts and CI SDK checkout.
- Standardized README (all 7 languages) and project banner to match the
  rest of the ecosystem's established-project structure.
- Promoted to `established`: manifest, docs, build-test/CI, real local
  verification and no private-doc references all confirmed - no
  functional gap found in this bridge's own small, SDK-delegated core.
