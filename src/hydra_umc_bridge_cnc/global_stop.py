"""The announcement of the global stop, as this bridge reads it.

When the server stops every robot it can announce it on `<mqtt prefix>/safety/estop` (a retained `SafetyState` message: `SAFE_STOP`, later `READY`). This module
keeps the last state the bridge heard of that topic and says whether a command that moves something may run.

Off by default: with the switch off the bridge does not even subscribe to the topic and behaves exactly as before. With the switch on:

* while the last message says `SAFE_STOP` (or says anything else than `READY`, or cannot be read), every command that moves something is refused with a reason;
  stops and read-only requests keep working, and the refusal is an answer, never silence;
* only a message that says `READY` ends it;
* a bridge that never heard the topic is left as it was, unless `strict` is also on: then it refuses until the first message arrives (a bridge that must not move
  before it knows the state of the installation).

The state lives in this process: it is read again from the broker (the message is retained) after every reconnect.
